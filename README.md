# Module 14 Challenge

This challenge was designed for us to create a tech blog where users can see others
posts, create an account and comment on the posts of other users. The site can be used by creating an account and logging in after opening the application. 

Assistance provided by Meg Meyers, tutor as well as template code found in the mini-project for Module 14 and Project 2 submission.
